# The is the Vic DELWP Fork of ANZMEST/GeoNetwork 3.x.x

The following files have been customised to include changes specific to DELWP:

web-ui/src/main/resources/catalog/locales/en-search.json 
web/src/main/webapp/WEB-INF/classes/setup/sql/data/data-db-default.sql

Other changes between 3.x.x and this fork can be found by doing a comparison between this fork and GeoNetwork 3.x.x.

The basic idea of this fork is customise GN for DELWP requirements.
